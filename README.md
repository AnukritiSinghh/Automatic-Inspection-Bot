# Automatic-Inspection-Bot
This is for my minor project during Bachelor's in Engineering. An inspection bot for springs in fright trains, using image segmentation and raspberry pi. 

We created our own dataset for different types of spring in trains, and also introduced a modified version of RMSProp algorithm.
